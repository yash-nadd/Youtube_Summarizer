- if you don’t believe me, let’s have a competition right now! the wind didn’t want to compete with his friend but the wind left him with no choice
- he agreed
- a young man was walking on the road below them
- the wind blew at the man with all his power and anger but it only made the man wrap his scarf and coat around him more tightly
- the man wrapped his arms around his legs and sat down by the road
- I think you have frozen the plight of the man who can get the scarf off him
- the sun ignored his friend and smiled at the man a little bit more
- as the sun’s smile grew bigger the man started feeling warmer and warmer
- he slowly took off his scarf off and flung it aside
- the wind did so while the sun continued to smile at him lightly
- the man went on his way, enjoying a pleasant day
- I am so glad you are my elder sister, Tia
- I know you will correct me without scolding me .
